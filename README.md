**Healthcare Monitoring with ARIMA Forecasting**
 
This repository contains a Python-based project for real-time healthcare monitoring, focusing on forecasting patient heart rates using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The project leverages a dataset of patient vitals to predict short-term heart rate trends, enabling potential anomaly detection and continuous monitoring in healthcare settings.
**Project Overview**
The project processes a dataset (healthcare_monitoring_dataset.csv) containing patient vitals such as heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2, and more, collected on May 17â€“18, 2025. The primary goal is to forecast heart rate for individual patients using time series analysis, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of ~2.5 BPM for short-term predictions. Key features include:

Data Preprocessing: Handles irregular timestamps via resampling to 1-minute intervals and interpolation.
ARIMA Modeling: Fits an ARIMA(5,d,1) model with adaptive differencing based on stationarity tests.
Real-Time Forecasting: Generates 10-minute heart rate predictions for continuous monitoring.
Error Handling: Robust checks for insufficient or constant data to ensure reliable analysis.
Visualization: Plots training, actual, and forecasted heart rates, saved as arima_heart_rate_forecast.png.

**Dataset**
The dataset (healthcare_monitoring_dataset.csv) includes the following columns:

Timestamp: Datetime (e.g., 2025-05-18 07:55:44.594978).
Patient ID: Unique identifiers (e.g., PAT1003, PAT1094).
Heart Rate: Beats per minute (BPM), numeric.
Blood Pressure, Blood Oxygen (SpO2), Respiratory Rate, Glucose Level, Temperature, ECG Signal, Activity Level, Label, Device ID: Additional vitals and metadata.

The dataset spans ~1 day with ~500 records, though patient-specific data (e.g., PAT1003) may be sparse, requiring resampling for time series analysis.
**Installation
Prerequisites**

Python 3.8 or higher
pip for package management

Setup

**Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Healthcare-Monitoring-ARIMA.git
cd Healthcare-Monitoring-ARIMA


**Install Dependencies:**
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn


**Prepare the Dataset:**

Place healthcare_monitoring_dataset.csv in the project root directory.
Ensure the file matches the expected format (see Dataset).



**Usage**

**Run the Analysis:**

Execute the main script to perform ARIMA forecasting for a patient (default: PAT1003):python arima_healthcare_monitoring.py


To analyze a different patient, modify patient_id in arima_healthcare_monitoring.py (e.g., patient_id = 'PAT1094').


**Outputs:**

Console: Displays data points, ADF test p-value, MAE, 10-minute forecast, and insights.
Files:
arima_heart_rate_forecast.png: Plot of training, actual, and forecasted heart rates.
arima_model.pkl: Saved ARIMA model for reuse.




**Sample Output:**
Initial Heart Rate data points for PAT1003: 3
Resampled Heart Rate data points: 22
ADF p-value: 0.1234
Mean Absolute Error: 2.50 BPM

Future 10-Minute Forecast:
                       Forecasted Heart Rate
2025-05-18 07:33:44.594978          75.23
...

**Insights from ARIMA Analysis:**
1. Model Fit: The ARIMA(5,1,1) model achieved an MAE of 2.50 BPM, indicating good accuracy.
2. Stationarity: The Heart Rate series required 1 order differencing, suggesting trending behavior.

**Future Improvements**

Multi-Patient Analysis: Extend the model to process multiple patients simultaneously.
Additional Vitals: Forecast other metrics like glucose levels or SpO2.
Anomaly Detection: Implement thresholds for detecting abnormal heart rates (e.g., >100 BPM).
Real-Time Integration: Deploy the model in a live monitoring system using streaming data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize ARIMA parameters (p,d,q) using grid search.
